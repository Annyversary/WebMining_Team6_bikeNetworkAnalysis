    "### Train-Validation Split\n",
    "\n",
    "For predicting edge attributes (e.g., `tracks`), an 80/20 train/validation split is applied to the **existing edges within each graph**. This means that the edges are randomly split into training and validation sets, while the nodes remain unchanged during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our application, the **nodes represent physically existing bike stations**, which typically do not change or only change very infrequently. The aim of the analysis is to model the **connections between stations**, i.e., to understand and predict how many bicycles move along certain routes (in other words: edges with weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **node-level split** (i.e., an 80/20 split of the nodes themselves) would mean that some stations would be completely unseen during training. This would not be meaningful because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **stations themselves are not the prediction target**;\n",
    "- It is the **relationships or transitions between the stations (edges)** that should be modeled;\n",
    "- In deployment, **all stations are known** (they are physically installed in the system);\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we wanted to use the `RandomLinkSplit()` function, but this is designed for classic link prediction â€“ i.e., binary classification. It adds both positive examples (existing edges) AND negative examples (non-existing edges). Since our task is an edge attribute regression task, this method is unsuitable, and we manually implemented the split mechanism using a random permutation of the edges. The `edge_attr_key_index` parameter is used to specify which edge attribute (e.g., `tracks`) is the target variable for prediction.\n"
